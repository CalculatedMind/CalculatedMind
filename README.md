- 👋 Hi, I’m @CalculatedMind
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Data Analytics. I have always been a calculated individual and I thoroughly enjoy researching just about anything. I have a newfound interest in Cyber Security, as well. So, my projects will be based on these topics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics Essentials, Data Science, & Excel.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project related to my interests. I am not one to limit my growth and knowledge base. So, collaborating on various projects is intriguing and exciting.
- 📫 I can be reached on GitHub, for now. I am working to create a profile on a different platform soon. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My mind is a constant calculator. I have a habit of randomly adding and dividing numbers. I guess it's my way of calming my mind and giving my mind an avenue to stay focused. A bit hard to explain, but it's me lol.
